# What is this:
An in-game script for Space Engineers which parses custom data text (in `myIni` format) to draw sprites on any and all text panels. It takes inspiration from the great [Fancy Flight Info](https://github.com/Blargmode/Fancy-flight-info) but handles things much differently (read: worse). I made this after desperately wanting something like it for about two years and for now it mostly reflects what I want my funny little displays to do.
# I want to use it, how do I get it
uhhhh go to [releases](https://github.com/godhatesaustralia/SEGraphicsManager/releases/) and download the latest, then open the guide PDF in that zip file. hopefully it will explain everything. if not hmu on discord. chances are you know me
# I am here for some other reason
who are you?? what are you doing here? are you lost?????? idk what i can do to help
